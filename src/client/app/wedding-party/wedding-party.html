              <h5>
                I met Katie Vertenten in junior high where we bonded over girl’s night of watching movies and doing make-overs. In high school, you could always catch us passing notes where we had secret code names for friends and crushes. We spent numerous years watching fireworks, taking long walks on the Riverwalk, and going to concerts. My first big night of drinking is owed to Katie where I learned that vodka (specifically vanilla) and I are not friends. Katie was there the whole time – shot by shot with me. As we grew-up, Katie has been a rock and a light especially through rough times. She always brightened my life with tickets to White Sox games or amazing events. Because of Katie, I got to watch the first post-season 2005 White Sox game against the Red Sox, and got to attend the black out game at Comiskey. I got to bowl with Carlton Fisk and Kenny Williams. We got to share the comeback of IU basketball live amongst all celebrating crimson and cream fans after the game winning buzzer shot. Katie is one of the most generous, loving and fun-hearted persons I know; and I am lucky to call her a friend, and role model.

              <h5>
                Kristen Dua and I met in grad school while working at the Front Desk. After countless late nights at works where we enjoyed Potbelly’s cookies we became friends. We lived near each other for a few years and would switch on/off with hosting dinner for each other. It was fun to try family favorites and new recipes. After a few back and forth conversation about rooming together, we became roommates. For five years we shared Roommate Confidentiality Night where we would spill our beans and feelings. One day we decided to jump out an airplane together, and there is no one else I would rather free fall with! There have been so many great times with this girl – one of the best was the first night we moved in together. We made a pizza and shared a bottle of champagne with Chambord. It was the start of a beautiful friendship. Kristen has been a constant blessing in my life, and like Katie I am lucky to call her a friend, and a roommate forever.

              <h5>
                Rebecca Masi and I also met in grad while I was working at the Front Desk and her in administrative office. I don’t know how it started, but Thursday night became our night at Ricochet’s where we refined our pool schools and talked endlessly about everything. Nothing is ever off topic when it comes to hanging out with Rebecca. We have spent a lot of nights watching TV, eating great food and desserts, drinking countless bottles of wine (and now bourbon) while just chatting about life and well just about anything… there is no bigger heart than Rebecca. She is always finding ways to experience life with friends and family – recently she and Tim, her husband, have taken me to see Foo Fighters and Saved by the Max.

              <h5>
                I met Jessie Parmelee way back in 2002 when we were both in the Louisville Ballet together. Somehow, we ended up hanging out a lot, talking on the phone until late at night, and generally becoming best friends. We shared a dream of making it big in the ballet world and supported each other when that dream seemed to be too far away. She introduced me to a church I would attend for quite a few years. I was proud (and a bit teary-eyed - who knew there was so much dust in Malibu) to stand with Jessie at her wedding. We've been best friends for a long, long time now, sharing everything. Even when we don't talk for a while (usually my fault), we pick up right where we left off.

              <h5>
                Harrison and I met on the first day of CIS-199 at the University of Louisville. We sat in the back of that class (and a few others) over the next three years. Working on projects for school, we became good friends. Having a mutual love of bourbon helps, and we would often hang out at Cumberland Brews on Bardstown Rd. After graduating, we kept hanging out, and tried to headhunt each once or twice. When I left the Louisville Ballet suddenly, Harrison was having a Derby party the next weekend, and that so helped me to take my mind off things. I was proud to stand with Harrison when he was married to his wife Sara. Harrison has been one of my closest friends for many years now.

              <h5>
                The one and only Brian Grant - Beast Mode Ballet himself. When Brian first came to Louisville to dance for the ballet, I saw potential in him and (sort of) took him under my wing. Little did I know that I would be gaining a life-long and loyal friend. When I retired from performing, Brian helped me out by moving in and becoming my roommate for the next three years while I finished my degree. While (I think) we both agree that we would never room with each other again, I was so glad to have such a good friend during those challenging years. Brian and I call each other "brother", and we mean it.
