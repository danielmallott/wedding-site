        <h3>Dan and Eileen met on <a href="http://www.match.com">Match.com</a> in April of 2015.
          Dan wanted to try a new way to meet people and Eileen's mother pressured her into signing up. Eileen was the first to reach out - sending a "wink".
          Dan responded, and shortly after they had their first date at ROCKS Lakeview, sharing a mutual love of bourbon.
          Fast forward one year, plenty of dates, a few trips (Louisville, Cincinnati, Milwaukee) and a lot of falling in love, Dan proposed to Eileen on April 16, 2016 at ROCKS Lakeview on the (almost) one year anniversary of their first date.
